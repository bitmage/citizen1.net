# Citizen 1 Introduction

What is Citizen 1?  Why are we making it?

Citizen 1 is rooted in the following understanding:

* We face systemic Economic, Political, and Ecological problems.
* These problems are inter-related, and cannot be solved in isolation from each other.
* Inequity and inequality are consequences of the way that we have been relating to each other, and to the world.
* We have already triggered self accelerating feedback loops in our climate.
* The best possible outcome for humanity at this time **must** involve an exponential increase in awareness, connectedness, and purposeful action.

Therefore, our mission is to foster the formation and growth of communities, participation in the political process, and formation of working groups to create solutions for citizens.

Citizen 1 is a communication network that gives you control of your digital life.

We are a community of active citizens from around the world who are working together to create applications that work for us.  We are sick of centralized organizations whose only business model is to profit from manipulating and wasting the time of their users.  We offer an honest business model of micropayments and donations.  You can go to our competition and get this for free.  But just remember, if you're not the customer, you're the product.

# We have work to do

Whether we choose to live in the city or in the country, we are surrounded by a man-made world.  The bridges, the roads, the power lines.  The walls of your house and the paint on it.  Much of this infrastructure was created by generations that came before us.

It's easy to take for granted that this is the way that it's always been.  It's easy to look at the factories, the automobiles, the court houses, and think that we can't possibly change it.  But it's helpful to remember that all of these things were created by people, to serve people.  And we have to ask the question today, do they still serve us?  What would serve us better?  Is there a better future that we want to live into?

Our economy functions the way it does because our government sets the rules of the game.  There are property laws, procedures for establishing companies.  There are regulations to prevent fraud, to set food and drug standards, and to protect the environment.  It's good to recognize and appreciate this.  There are many countries in the world where you will get sick if you eat the food or drink the water.  There are many countries where banking is not accessible.  But here too, we need to ask the question of whether the economy serves us as well as it could.  Whether the government serves us as well as it could.  And if not, what would that look like?  Can we articulate a better future for ourselves?  Our forefathers did, or we would still be living in a feudal society.  Do we lack the imagination to ask what's next?

As purveyors, curators of a set of communication tools, we are not here to convince you of our politics.  But we are here to facilitate the discussion, and to create a forum where you can find what is meaningful to you, begin to connect with others, and yes, perhaps even act on your beliefs.  It is our truest belief and desire that all human beings shall be supported in their "pursuit of happiness", regardless of background.  And that is why we are here.

# What we offer

We are building apps that follow a certain set of principles:

* Data is decentralized.  That means you own it.  It's on your phone, on your computers, and on other people's computers that you rent space on.
* Data is encrypted.  That means that if you store it on someone else's computers, they can't read it.
* We give you fine grained control over data in, data out from your apps.  Nothing happens without your permission.  No servers operating in the darkness.  No Sauron.  No orcs.  Only hobbits with round doors and hairy feet.

# Why hasn't anyone else done this before?

Well... actually there are some pretty hard technical challenges that needed to be worked out in order to make this possible.  One of the reasons that we have had centralized organizations for so long is because it makes the technology less complex, and makes the governance and policy easier to manage.

So moving into a world where you can have a group of computers that just "figure out" how to talk to each other, where to store your data, how many copies to keep, etc. is a pretty significant step.

# What is possible now?

One of our greatest hopes is that by making the Citizen once again a paying customer, that the incentives will shift and we will see apps that truly serve the individual rather than the corporate sponsors.  In addition, we think that putting the data in your hands allows new categories of applications to be built.

When you consider the possibility of a digital assistant and you apply the current centralized model, you might be a little creeped out by the idea of giving control over every aspect of your communication and life to a company that has no real accountability to you.  And based on their track record, it's very clear that companies are indeed selling your data to the highest bidder, and have no regard for your safety or privacy.

But that doesn't mean that the idea of a digital assistant is fundamentally bad.  It just means that you'd like it to actually work for you, instead of spying on you.  So one of the things we're hoping to do is enable you to feel comfortable sharing **more** data with your apps, but with the confidence that they can't take all that data and run with it.  We do that by intercepting **all** communications that your applications send, and running them through a set of rules that you control.

We're hoping to see some major applications in the following categories:

* Text/Video Chatting
* Community Organizing
* Event Management
* Crypto Currency/Banking
* AI Powered, Personalized News Feeds
* Medical Record Viewing/Sharing
* Identity Management
* Project Coordination
* Life Coaching

Many of these are really *personal* and private, and we *aren't* comfortable sharing these details with just anyone.  We need a platform that works for us.
