# Be an informed citizen

I'm just a concerned citizen in a crazy world.  Maybe you can relate!

I'd like to share some information that has shaped my understanding of current events, the world, and my place in it.  You may find it interesting as well.

On this page you'll find not hours, but many days worth of material to consume.  So take your time.  If you find these ideas challenge some of your assumptions, I encourage you to look at a wide variety of sources and come to your own conclusions.

I have no interest in convincing you of anything, beyond the hope that we can both live in a more friendly, happy, and habitable world.

# Understanding the banking crisis (and why it's not over)

The most crucial thing to understand about the banking crisis is the [Glass-Steagal Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass%E2%80%93Steagall_legislation).  The Glass Steagal act was created as a response to the great depression.  One of the destabilizing factors that **led** to the great depression was banks using the funds that had been invested in them for "speculative banking".  Essentially they are gambling with the money they've been given.  What Glass Steagal did was stop the money in your checking account and your pension funds from being gambled with.

In 1999, Bill Clinton dissolved the Glass Steagal Act.  9 years later, we had a world wide financial crisis.  The trading of "toxic" real estate assets was allowed to transpire because there was no regulation to stop it.  After the 2008 crisis, Obama signed into law the Dodd Frank Act to prevent this kind of real estate fraud from happening again.  However, there's nothing to stop banks from engaging in every other activity classified as "speculative banking" as long as it escapes the narrow scope of the Dodd Frank Act.

Here's a [conversation between Bernie Sanders and Nomi Prins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdNOsGFhDb8) - a Wall Street insider who gives her perspective on their practices and objectives.

Preventing this kind of crisis is pretty straight forward.  We need our government to work for us instead of for the banks.  We need to reinstate the Glass Steagal act, which was already doing a great job of protecting us from this kind of event.  Should we go further?  Should we break up the banks?  Possibly.  But regardless, we need to find a common voice and demand the change we need from our government.

# Climate Change

A lot of people are concerned about climate change, but might not be fully informed on the specific understanding we have of planetary systems, and the predictions that science is making for the future.  It's worth understanding, as it will majorly affect the economy, the refugee crisis, and could endanger you personally if you live in a coastal city.  Other people may be skeptical about climate change.

On the side of denying/debunking the human role: One of the sources I've found here is [Christopher Monckton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGqcweY1a3I).  Sounds somewhat convincing, but here's a page [documenting his past statements and affiliations](https://www.desmogblog.com/christopher-monckton).  Notably:

    The New York Times writes “He has accepted more than $1.2 million in money from the fossil-fuel industry over the last decade while failing to disclose that conflict of interest in most of his scientific papers.” These articles were written in light of documents obtained by Greenpeace through freedom of information filings.

Here's some commentary from our friend [Neil DeGrasse Tyson on why we shouldn't cherry pick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1MZ8U8C9c8) a small percentage of reports that agree with our presuppositions.

In the main stream camp I would place the IPCC report.  The IPCC is the largest gathering of scientific minds in world history.  Every year they publish an update on their summary of the world's relationship with climate change.  [Please consider reading the summary and conclusions](http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg2/).  There's a massive amount of information being integrated here, from sensors all over the world, and being analyzed by practitioners of nearly all branches of scientific study.  And the resulting report is what they can be brought to agree on.  It may have its flaws, but this is the same scientific method that has brought us cell phones, satellites and MRIs.  There is a high likelyhood that what they have to say is relevant to our situation.  The Paris Accords and other climate related policy is informed by the IPCC.  Here's a series of short interviews [asking scientists to reflect on the Paris Accord goals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzMtIqbtD5Y).

Now another point I want to make is that the IPCC is not extreme - they are in the center.  They are only presenting the most rigorously proven conclusions, and they have to stand up to political pressure to reduce the goals (such as the Paris accord targets) that would need to be made to swing the needle back into the habitable zone.  Politicians are looking for a compromise, and they're looking for solutions that don't jeopardize economic growth.  **The IPCC report overlooks the possibility that our eternal, exponential economic growth may be incompatible with continuing human life on the planet.**

There are scientists on the other side of the bell curve, who think that climate change is potentially even more serious than the IPCC predicts.  For instance [Kevin Anderson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIODRrnHQxg) who lays out the case well.  He presents some of the risks which are not being taken into consideration by the IPCC report, feedback loops such as: decreasing albedo due to melting ice on the poles, exponential release of methane from melting permafrost, and shutting of of the [AMOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_meridional_overturning_circulation).  Watch [Guy McPhearson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVpkTKZoq48) or [Paul Beckwith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGw5bun2dFk) if you want a far more pessimistic look at our situation.

You might find them depressing to listen to.  I sympathize.  But can you find anyone debunking the data that these scientists are basing their conclusions on?  I haven't found any evidence to the contrary.  I hope Kevin is right and there's still action we can take, but I think the feedback loops in the environment present very critical threats to our survival.

# Understanding World Politics and Military Intervention

This is a [brilliant talk from Tariq Ali of Teleseur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plolHOfODRc).  It outlines the history and current circumstance of global neo-liberal policy, and consequences of pursuing an exploitative form of capitalism globally.

If you haven't read it, I can't recommend highly enough [The People's History of the United States](https://www.amazon.com/Peoples-History-United-States/dp/0062397346).  One thing I took from this book was a new understanding of the role that workers rights movements played in obtaining the civil liberties that we enjoy today.

It's so important, because today we see language and facts being twisted.  The language of individualism, pride, and smaller government has been used to justify demolishing the programs which were responsible for the rise of the middle class and a rise in the standard of living in the FDR era after the Great Depression.  These programs were not a "hand out" - workers were demanding to be compensated for their hours with a decent quality of life.

When you fight for smaller government, you are fighting to remove the regulations that protect your water, your air, and your food.  You are fighting to remove your own health care, and remove any protections you have of fair working conditions.  When politicians promise you smaller government, they're not sizing down the military budget, or corporate subsidies.  They're not reducing corruption or waste.  It's the social programs that protect you the citizen that are being dismantled.

When you are told that the reason we can't balance the budget is handouts to immigrants and minorities, you're being emotionally manipulated.  The working class is being turned against itself, and the real policies that are coming out of this language are destroying all of us. 

[The TPP is a recent and terrifying example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnC1mqyAXmw).  In the name of free trade, this is a bill that would create a tribunal of corporate lawyers to override the supreme court of our country and all the other countries involved, and allow them to file suit against our governments if any regulations are created which diminish their profits.  This is a direct forfeture of our nation's sovereignty!  Did you realize that was at stake? The TPP was killed by Trump when he got elected (which surprised me), but [there are 11 other countries that signed the deal](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43326314).  You can [read more objections to it here](https://www.citizen.org/our-work/globalization-and-trade/nafta-wto-other-trade-pacts/tafta).

# Understanding Consumerism, Advertising and Propaganda

Everyone alive today is under the influence of propaganda.  The only question is whether you recognize it or not.  No matter who you are, there are things that set you off, [where the answer is so clear to you that it doesn't even bear contemplation](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman-ebook/dp/B00555X8OA).  This feels like you're defending yourself, but in reality, this is a weakness that the political and corporate world will use to put you into a demographic.  They proceed to use demographic groups to control people en masse.  Reacting to your hot button issues, you will ignore the real issues at stake, and they will be able to quietly pass policies that errode your liberties, health, and happiness.

In personal conversations I find both liberals and conservatives restating the agenda of their favorite news source as their own, and often times they are quite defensive and unwilling to hear any other viewpoints.  What causes people to identify so strongly with a message?

The truth is that mass manipulation of the public opinion is an art and science that was mastered in the 20th century.  Today the art is so wide spread and embedded in every successful company that every electronic device you own is screaming for your attention.  The success metric of today's leading industries is your attention.  It is bought and sold, and no one truly cares for your benefit beyond the moment you click the buy button.

[Century of Self is a four hour documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ3RzGoQC4s) on how consumerism, advertising, and propaganda were developed based on Freudian psychology.  There is a history behind this, and it was developed with specific intent, and tremendous success.  It's worth your 4 hours because it shapes nearly every aspect of the culture in which you live.

Something to reflect on once you have watched this: [90% of United States media is controlled by 6 companies](https://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6?IR=T).  In what ways are those companies using the techniques described in Century of Self?  How powerful is their influence on the story that US citizens tell themselves?  And how is that manifesting in our lives?

One of the techniques mentioned in Century of Self is the [VALS Survey](http://www.strategicbusinessinsights.com/vals/ustypes.shtml).  Feel free to take it for yourself.  What does it mean when marketing groups are separating people, essentially based on Maslow's Heirarchy, and determining how to sell their products to that group?  Do corporations have any interest in helping people to advance on this heirarchy?  It seems unlikely, since that would make it difficult to sell to them using the same strategies.  What are the impacts of living in a society where it has become the norm to try and take advantage of anyone you can?

Today the level of manipulation we face is at an even greater degree, due to our consumption of digital media.  The media we see is controlled by algorithms that serve those with the wealth to pay for our attention.  Please take a look at [humanetech.com](http://humanetech.com/problem/) for a very well articulated story of our situation and what we need to do about it.

# Psychology of Happiness

[This study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230727489_Harlow_L.L.__Newcomb_M.D._%281990%29._Towards_a_general_hierarchical_model_of_meaning_and_satisfaction_in_life._Multivariate_Behavioral_Research_25_387-405) found that human happiness is comprised of three major pillars: work and health, relationships, and pursuit of meaning.  Wow!  Tall order, huh?  There's a lot of depth you could go into on each one of those categories.  But I find this is a useful lens to look at my own life through.  I ask myself whether I am happy and whether my actions are serving me in each of these areas.
